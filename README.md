# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a sentiment analysis model that can accurately classify text as positive, negative, or neutral. The model will be trained on a dataset of labeled text samples and will utilize various natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment.

## Features

- **Model Training**: The model is trained on a dataset of labeled text samples, which includes both positive and negative reviews.
- **Text Preprocessing**: The text data is preprocessed to remove stop words, punctuation, and special characters, and to convert all text to lowercase.
- **Tokenization**: The text is tokenized into individual words or phrases to facilitate analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: The model uses various NLP techniques, including bag-of-words and word embeddings, to analyze the sentiment of the text.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for this project.
- **NLTK**: The Natural Language Toolkit library is used for text preprocessing and tokenization.
- **spaCy**: The spaCy library is used for word embeddings and sentiment analysis.
- **TensorFlow**: The TensorFlow library is used for model training and evaluation.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk spacy tensorflow
